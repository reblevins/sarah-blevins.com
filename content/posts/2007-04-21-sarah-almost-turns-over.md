While lying in her playpen, Sarah has already been performing such acrobatical feats as turning herself around with her feet. In this way, she can turn a complete circle.

She had also been turning herself on her side, but today she almost tipped over onto her stomach. Unfortunately, the arm that was underneath her wasn&#8217;t cooperating so she couldn&#8217;t go all the way.

Oh well, baby, keep trying. We&#8217;re rootin&#8217; for ya&#8217;.
