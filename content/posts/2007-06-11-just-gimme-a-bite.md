Sarah is so ready for solid food. As you can see in this cute video, anytime you&#8217;re holding her and eating or drinking something, she wants to take a bite/drink.

If you&#8217;ve got a cup in your hand, she&#8217;ll literally grab it and try an dput it to her mouth to drink! A little advanced for a 5 month old if you ask me. But hey, I could be biased.

We&#8217;ll probably start her on solid food soon, but doctors say that if your nursing, then it&#8217;s best to wait until six months to start with solid food. That way you reduce the risk of developing food allergies.
