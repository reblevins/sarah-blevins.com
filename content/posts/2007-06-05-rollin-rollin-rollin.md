That&#8217;s right, Sarah&#8217;s a rollin&#8217; away. In fact, just about the first thing she does when we put her down in her playpen is to start rolling over. We know to keep an ear open for her, because she gets tired after a while and starts to fuss. Then we roll her onto her back and sometimes she stays there and sometimes she rolls right back onto her stomach.

Kids these days!
