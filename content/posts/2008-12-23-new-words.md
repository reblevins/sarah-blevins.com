In the last few weeks, Sarah had been saying many new words.  Most of them, as you can imagine since we&#8217;re in the US are English.  She started saying &#8220;Lisa&#8221; before we came to the US, but she still has trouble saying the &#8216;s&#8217;, so it sounds kind of like &#8220;Liha&#8221;.

Some other new words:
  
bite
  
lights (because of all the Christmas lights)
