We were at a restaurant the other day with the girls and there was a family sitting at the table next to us with a mom, dad, and presumably a grandmother. What caught Sarah&rsquo;s attention, though was the baby being comforted by it&rsquo;s mother. She kept saying &ldquo;baby, baby&rdquo;. I pointed to the mother and said &ldquo;mama&rdquo;, and she repeated that. She then pointed to the father and said &ldquo;daddy&rdquo;. I agreed and then pointed out the grandmother sitting with them. At that point I noticed her looking around, scanning the restaurant and other tables. I wondered what was going on in her little mind until she shrugged her shoulders with her palms up in the air &#8211; which she does when she&rsquo;s asking where something or someone is &#8211; and asked &ldquo;baba?&rdquo; which is her word for &ldquo;opa&rdquo; (Dutch for Grandpa). She had noticed that there was a Grandma present at the table, but Grandpa was missing. I found it to be an astute observation for a 22 month old child.
