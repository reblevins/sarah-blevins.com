Well, mostly okay. She did pretty well during the day, only asking for it a few times the first couple of days.  The nights, however, were pretty hairy.  Anyway, she&#8217;s off it now, which is, of course much better for her in the long run (especially her teeth) even though it may have cost her and us some blood, sweat and tears.
