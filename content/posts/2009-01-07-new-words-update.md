Sarah has been saying a lot of new things this week.

When she burps, she says: &#8220;scuse me&#8221;.

We were driving home the other night, and Jo was trying to get Lisa to turn the light by her seat off.  She finally resorted to the old parental trick of counting to three.  She didn&#8217;t get very far, because after having said, &#8220;one&#8221;, Sarah helped her out by adding: &#8220;two!&#8221;

Yesterday, she looked at a Lisa&#8217;s empty bowl of rice and said, &#8220;no rice&#8221;.

Today, she ran to the closet where we keep our jackets and said, &#8220;my jacky&#8221;.
