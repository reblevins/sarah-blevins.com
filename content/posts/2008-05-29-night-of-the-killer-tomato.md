We got Sarah to sleep this evening before 7PM, which hasn&#8217;t happened in a long time!  And then, both girls woke up at 8:30PM, crying and wide awake, so we took them both downstairs, gave them something to drink and eat.  We finally got them back up stairs around 10PM and Lisa went back to sleep fairly quickly, but Sarah didn&#8217;t want to sleep.

  Jolanda took her back downstairs and tried to comfort her, but she kept crying.  What she wanted?  A tomato.  She didn&#8217;t want to eat it, she just wanted to hold it.  Every time we tried to take it away from her, she started screaming so we gave it back.  We thought se might be hungry, so we offered her some crackers and other things, but no, she wasn&#8217;t hungry, she just wanted her tomato to hold onto.

  Finally, after 11PM she started getting tired, we were getting tired too, but there was still one small issue to deal with.  Yup, what to do about the tomato?  We finally decided to pull a fast one on her, so we pulled the tomato out of her hands and gave her a bouncy ball about the same size.  It was dark, so we thought, hey, let&#8217;s give it a try.  She cried for a little bit simply because of hurt feelings that we would try to take her tomato away, but it worked!  We finally got her upstairs and asleep, but we&#8217;ll never forgot the Night of the Killer Tomato.
