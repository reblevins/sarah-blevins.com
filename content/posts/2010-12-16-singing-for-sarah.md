Here at Heidebeek, when we have our community meal on Wednesdays, we always sing for the kids who have had a birthday or will be having one in the coming days. This last Wednesday, we sang for all the kids who will be having birthdays during the Christmas break and Sarah is one of those as you can [see in this video][1].
