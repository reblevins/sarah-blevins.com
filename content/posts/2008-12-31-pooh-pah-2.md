Sarah&rsquo;s favorite word is pooh pah. It has various meanings: baby, candy, poop, toilet, diaper. The other day Uncle Terry was trying to get her to say candy. He kept saying it to her over and over. At one point she seemed to be ignoring him. She finally walked away and said emphatically &ldquo;pooh pah&rdquo;.
