First of all, we would like to thank you all very much for your prayers, cards and e-mails for Sarah. They were all very encouraging. Sarah&rsquo;s surgical procedure went well. We were in at 7:15AM and we were leaving to go home by 10:30AM. We weren&rsquo;t actually supposed to let her play outside, but that afternoon she insisted on going outside to play, so we let her.

The rest of the week went well, until Friday night. She was up most of the night (and we were, too) with what we figured was a terrible earache. Thankfully we could get her in to see the Ear, Nose and Throat specialist on Saturday and he prescribed her some ear drops for her left ear, which was a little clogged up. It cleared up almost right away and she didn&rsquo;t seem to have any more pain in her ear. Since then, she has being doing well, except for a little cold. We go back next Tuesday, July 8th for a checkup.
